# üß† Python Quiz App with Score Tracking

### Intermediate Level Project ‚Äî Built with Core Python

---

## üìö Introduction

This project presents a Python-based quiz application designed to support self-assessment through interactive learning. With features like score tracking, random question selection, and optional GUI, it‚Äôs perfect for intermediate Python learners. Built using lists, dictionaries, OOP, lambda functions, and randomization, it serves as a lightweight, modular learning tool.

## üß† Strategy

**Team:**  
- Mithi Kumari (Captain)  
- Akshat Gupta  
- Sameer Husain  
- Lochan  
- Anuj Pandey  
*B.Tech CSE, The ICFAI University*

**Tech Stack & Concepts Used:**
- Python  
- Numpy *(for analytics, optional)*  
- Tkinter *(optional GUI)*  
- Random module  
- Lambda functions  
- Lists & Dictionaries  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Architecture:**
1. **Input Layer:** User interacts via CLI or GUI  
2. **Processing Layer:** Random question selection & scoring  
3. **Storage Layer:** Question bank and score tracking using dictionaries  
4. **Output Layer:** Displays score and feedback

**Weekly Plan:**
- Week 1: Set up structure, practiced dictionaries & strings  
- Week 2: Developed quiz logic with randomization  
- Week 3: GUI integration using Tkinter  
- Week 4: Testing, feedback, and bug fixes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

- Questions, options, and answers stored using dictionaries
- Random module for unpredictable selection
- Lambda functions for efficient logic handling
- OOP approach to structure the app into classes
- GUI developed with Tkinter for a user-friendly experience
- CLI version also possible for basic usage

## ‚úÖ Results

- Randomized question flow works smoothly  
- Accurate score tracking and lives counter  
- User-friendly GUI with clean design  
- Bug-free initial testing  
- Code is reusable and extendable due to modular design

## üîÆ Conclusion & Future Goals

The Python Quiz App has fulfilled its core goals: dynamic quizzes, scoring, and a clean interface. The project is modular, easy to extend, and beginner-friendly.

### üõ† Planned Improvements:
- Add **SQLite** for persistent score/history saving  
- Convert to web version using **Flask/Django**  
- Include **data visualization** for analytics  
- Integrate **question APIs** for dynamic content  

### üöÄ New Future Goals:
- User **login/authentication system**  
- **Difficulty levels** and **question categories**  
- **Leaderboard** and social sharing  
- **Mobile app version** using Kivy/Flutter  
- **Voice-assisted Q&A** for accessibility  
- **Trend tracking** on user performance
